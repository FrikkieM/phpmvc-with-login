NOTES:
------
1. Remember: Update .htacess file under "public" to point to base: RewriteBase /phpframework/public

2. Typical workflow to add an ITEM/TABLE for interaction, e.g. POSTS:
    - Create TABLE for ITEM
    - Create Controller for ITEM
    - Implement Access Control for ITEM
    - ITEM Model & Display
    - Add ITEM Form
    - Handle CRUD:
        - Inserting ITEM
        - Show Details for ITEM
        - Editing ITEM
        - Deleting ITEM

This Framework is based on TraversyMVC and was built while doing that course on Udemy.
